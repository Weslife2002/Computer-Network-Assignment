To launch, you need to open terminal and launch server first.
In this step, you need to pass in the command:
<python> server.py <RTSP port>
e.g: python server.py 5050
Then the server will print out its address <ipaddress, RTSP port>

Then you need to launch client by type in this command:
<python> ClientLauncher.py <RTSP port> <RTP port> <filename>
e.g: python ClientLauncher.py 5050 9999 movie.Mjpeg

The client GUI will pop up and there 're four buttons: SETUP, PLAY, PAUSE, TEARDOWN
You need to click on SETUP first to open the RTP connection.
Then you can click on PLAY to enjoy the movie.
You can PAUSE any time by click on PAUSE.
TEARDOWN will allow you to close all RTSP and RTP connection and also close the connection.
