# Computer-Network-Assignment
This is my computer network assignment about RTP and RTSP protocol, which is used to transmit data between client and server.
The initial folder that teacher gave me had the rtppacket.py and client.py not done and I was in charge of completing those files.

The Client.py file I did by learning from youtube (Python Socket Programming Tutorial - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QiPPX-KeSc), as well as reading the application document provided by teacher (VideoStreamingApplication.pdf) and also reading code from the server side. That helps me a lot about understanding how the server and client communicate.

However, the listenRtp function in Client.py and the rtppacket.py file I did copied and edit from https://github.com/macchicken/python-work/tree/master/COMP5416/assignment2
